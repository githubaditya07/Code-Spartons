    Soil contamination or soil pollution as part of land degradation is caused by the presence of
xenon biotic chemicals or other alteration in the natural soil environment. It is typically caused
by industrial activity, agricultural chemicals or improper disposal of waste.
</p>
<h2 class="soil_head">Causes of soil pollution:</h2>
<ul>
    <li><p>Soil pollution can be natural or due to human activity. However, it mostly boils down to the
        activities of the human that causes the majority of soil pollution such as heavy industries, or
        pesticides in agriculture.
        Industrial activities including mining, smelting and manufacturing; domestic, livestock and
        municipal wastes; pesticides, herbicides, fertilizers used in agriculture; petroleum-derived
        products that are released into or break-down in the environment; fumes generated by
        transportation all contribute to the problem. These include pharmaceuticals, endocrine
        disruptors, hormones and biological pollutants; "e-waste" from old electronics; and the plastics
        that are nowadays used in almost every human endeavor.
        </p></li>

  </ul>

<h2 class="soil_head">Effects of soil Pollution:</h2>
<ul>
    <li><p>Soil pollution affects plants, animals and humans a like. While anyone is susceptible to soil
        pollution, soil pollution effects may vary based on age, general health status and other factors,
        such as the type of pollutant or contaminant inhaled or ingested. However, children are usually
        more susceptible to exposure to contaminants, because they come in close contact with the soil
        by playing in the ground; combined with lower thresholds for disease,( headaches, nausea, and
        vomiting, coughing, pain in the chest, and wheezing) this triggers higher risks than for adults.
        Therefore, it is always important to test the soil before allowing your kids to play there,
        especially if you live in a highly industrialized area.
        </p></li>

</ul>

<h2 class="soil_head">Ways To Reduce Soil Pollution:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>Excavation and subsequent transportation of polluted soils to remote, uninhabited
        locations.
    </p></li>

    <li>
    <p>Extraction of pollutants via thermal remediation â€“ the temperature is raised in order to
        force the contaminants into the vapor phase, after which they can be collected through
        vapors extraction
    </p></li>

    <li>
    <p>Bioremediation or phytoremediation involves the use of microorganisms and plants for
        the decontamination of soil.
        </p></li>

    <li>
    <p>Mycoremediation involves the use of fungi for the accumulation of heavy metal
        contaminants. </p></li>
