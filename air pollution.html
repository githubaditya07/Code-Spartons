    Air pollution is a mixture of solid particles and gases in the air. Car emissions, chemicals from
factories, dust, and pollen and mold spores may be suspended as particles. Ozone, a gas, is a
major part of air pollution in cities. When ozone forms air pollution, it's also called smog.
Some air pollutants are poisonous.
“Air pollution occurs when harmful or excessive quantities of substances are introduced into
Earth's atmosphere. Sources of air pollution include gases, particulates, and biological
molecules.”
“Air pollution refers to the release of pollutants into the air that are detrimental to human
health and the planet as a whole.”
</p>
<h2 class="air_head">Causes of air pollution:</h2>
<ul>
    <li> <h4> Burning of Fossil Fuels:</h4></li>
    <p>The combustion of fossil fuels emits a large amount of sulphur dioxide. Carbon monoxide
        released by incomplete combustion of fossil fuels also results in air pollution.
    </p>

    <li> <h4>Automobiles:</h4></li>
    <p>The gases emitted from vehicles such as jeeps, trucks, cars, buses, etc. pollute the
        environment. These are the major sources of greenhouse gases and also result in diseases
        among individuals.
    </p>

    <li> <h4> Agricultural Activities:</h4></li>
    <p>Ammonia is one of the most hazardous gases emitted during agricultural activities. The
        insecticides, pesticides and fertilizers emit harmful chemicals in the atmosphere and
    contaminate it.</p>

    <li> <h4> Factories and Industries:</h4></li>
    <p>Factories and industries are the main source of carbon monoxide, organic compounds,
        hydrocarbons, and chemicals. These are released into the air degrading its quality.</p>

    <li> <h4> Mining Activities:</h4></li>
    <p>In the mining process, the minerals below the earth are extracted using large pieces of
        equipment. The dust and chemicals released during the process not only pollute the air but
        also deteriorate the health of the workers and people living in the nearby areas.</p>

    <li> <h4> Domestic Sources:</h4></li>
    <p>The household cleaning products and paints contain toxic chemicals that are released in
        the air. The smell from the newly painted walls is the smell of the chemicals present in the
        paints. It not only pollutes the air but also affects breathing</p>

  </ul>

<h2 class="air_head">Effects of Air Pollution:</h2>
<ul>
    <li> <h4> Diseases:</h4></li>
    <p>Air pollution has resulted in several respiratory disorders and heart diseases among humans.
        The cases of lung cancer have increased in the last few decades. Children living near polluted
        areas are more prone to pneumonia and asthma. 
    </p>

    <li> <h4>Global Warming:</h4></li>
    <p>Due to the emission of greenhouse gases, there is an imbalance in the gaseous composition of
        the air. This has led to an increase in the temperature of the earth. This increase in earth’s
        temperature is known as global warming. 
    </p>

    <li> <h4> Acid Rain:</h4></li>
    <p>The burning of fossil fuels releases harmful gases such as nitrogen oxides and sulphur oxides
        in the air. The water droplets combine with these pollutants, become acidic, and fall as acid
        rain which damages human, animal and plant life.</p>

    <li> <h4> Ozone Layer Depletion:</h4></li>
    <p>The release of chlorofluorocarbons (CFC), halons, and hydrochlorofluorocarbons in the
        atmosphere is the major cause of depletion of the ozone layer. The depleting ozone layer does
        not prevent the harmful ultraviolet rays coming from the sun and causes skin diseases and eye
        problems among individuals.</p>

    <li> <h4> Effect on Animals:</h4></li>
    <p>The air pollutants suspend on the water bodies and affect the aquatic life. Pollution also
        compels the animals to leave their habitat and shift to a new place. </p>

</ul>

<h2 class="air_head">Ways To Reduce Air Pollution:</h2>
<ul>
    <li> <h4> Avoid Using Vehicles:</h4></li>
    <p>People should avoid using vehicles for shorter distances. Rather they should prefer public
        modes of transport to travel from one place to another. This not only prevents pollution but
        also conserves energy
    </p>

    <li> <h4>Energy Conservation: </h4></li>
    <p>A large number of fossil fuels are burnt to generate electricity. Therefore, do not forget to
        switch off the electrical appliances when not in use. Thus, you can save the environment at the
        individual level. Use of energy-efficient devices such CFLs also controls pollution to a greater
        level.
    </p>

    <li> <h4> Use of Energy efficient appliances:</h4></li>
    <p>Whether at the domestic level or at the industrial level, we must push for appliances that use
        energy efficiently, which result in complete combustion of fuel, as incomplete combustion
        causes air pollution.
        </p>

    <li> <h4> Shifting industries:    </h4></li>
    <p>Another possible solution to reduce the harmful effects of air pollution is to shift the
        manufacturing plants, factories and industries to remote areas with a low level of population. </p>

    <li> <h4> Using Modern Techniques:</h4></li>
    <p>With technology making great advancements, there are now technologies available that can
        help reduce the release of pollutants in the air. Air filters, scrubbers, precipitators are just a few
        examples. </p>
