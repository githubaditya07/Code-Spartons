<p class="pollution_">Pollution is the introduction of contaminants into the natural environment that causes adverse
  change. Pollution can take the form of chemical substances or energy, such as noise, heat or
  light. Pollutants, the components of pollution, can be either foreign substances/energies or
  naturally occurring contaminants.
  Environmental pollution is one of the most serious problems facing humanity and other life
  forms on our planet today. “Environmental pollution is defined as “the contamination of the
  physical and biological components of the earth/atmosphere system to such an extent that
  normal environmental processes are adversely affected.” Pollutants can be naturally occurring
  substances or energies, but they are considered contaminants when in excess of natural levels.
  Any use of natural resources at a rate higher than nature’s capacity to restore itself can result in
  pollution of air, water, and land.
  Environmental pollution is of different types namely air, water, soil, noise and light-weight.
  These cause damage to the living system. How pollution interacts with public health,
  environmental medicine and the environment has undergone dramatic change.
