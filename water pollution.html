    Water pollution is the contamination of water bodies, usually as a result of human
activities. Water bodies include for example lakes, rivers, oceans, aquifers and
groundwater. Water pollution results when contaminants are introduced into the natural
environment.
“Water is essential to life. It need not be spelt out exactly how important it is. Yet water
pollution is one of the most serious ecological threats we face today.”
Water pollution happens when toxic substances enter water bodies such as lakes, rivers, oceans
and so on, getting dissolved in them, lying suspended in the water or depositing on the bed.
This degrades the quality of water. Not only does this spell disaster for aquatic ecosystems, the
pollutants also seep through and reach the groundwater, which might end up in our households
as contaminated water we use in our daily activities, including drinking.
</p>
<h2 class="water_head">Causes of water pollution:</h2>
<ul>
    <li> <h4> Agrochemicals</h4></li>
    <p>Agrochemicals like fertilizers (containing nitrates and phosphates) and pesticides (insecticides,
        fungicides, herbicides etc.) washed by rain-water and surface runoff pollute water
    </p>

    <li> <h4>Storm water runoff:
    </h4></li>
    <p>Carrying various oils, petroleum products, and other contaminants from urban and rural areas
        (ditches). These usually forms sheens on the water surface.
        
    </p>

    <li> <h4> Sewage:</h4></li>
    <p>Emptying the drains and sewers in fresh water bodies causes water pollution. The problem is
        severe in cities.</p>

    <li> <h4> Mining activities:</h4></li>
    <p>Mining activities involve crushing rocks that usually contain many trace metals and sulfides.
        The leftover material from mining activities may easily generate sulfuric acid in the presence
        of precipitation water.</p>

    <li> <h4> Industrial Effluents:
    </h4></li>
    <p>Industrial wastes containing toxic chemicals, acids, alkalis, metallic salts, phenols, cyanides,
        ammonia, radioactive substances, etc., are sources of water pollution. They also cause thermal
        (heat) pollution of water.</p>

    <li> <h4> Burning of fossil fuels:
    </h4></li>
    <p>the emitted ash particles usually contain toxic metals (such as As or Pb). Burning will also add
        a series of oxides including carbon dioxide to air and, respectively, water bodies.
        </p>

    <li> <h4> Animal waste:</h4></li>
    <p>Contribute to the biological pollution of water streams. Think of it this way: anything that can
        cause air pollution or soil pollution may also affect water bodies and cause innumerable
        ecological and human health issues.</p>
  </ul>

<h2 class="water_head">Effects of Air Pollution:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>Water bodies in the vicinity of urban areas are extremely polluted. This is the result of
        dumping garbage and toxic chemicals by industrial and commercial establishments. 
    </p>
    </li>

    <li>
    <p>Water pollution drastically affects aquatic life. It affects their metabolism, behavior, causes
        illness and eventual death. Dioxin is a chemical that causes a lot of problems from
        reproduction to uncontrolled cell growth or cancer. This chemical is bioaccumulated in fish,
        chicken and meat. Chemicals such as this travel up the food chain before entering the human
        body.
        
    </p></li>

    <li>
    <p>The effect of water pollution can have a huge impact on the food chain. It disrupts the foodchain. Cadmium and lead are some toxic substances, these pollutants upon entering the food
        chain through animals (fish when consumed by animals, humans) can continue to disrupt at
        higher levels.</p></li>

    <li> 
    <p>Humans are affected by pollution and can contract diseases such as hepatitis through faucal
        matter in water sources. Poor drinking water treatment and unfit water can always cause an
        outbreak of infectious diseases such as cholera etc.</p></li>

    <li>
    <p>The ecosystem can be critically affected, modified and destructured because of water
        pollution.
         </p></li>

</ul>

<h2 class="water_head">Control Of Water Pollution</h2>
<ul class="ul1">
    <li> <p>Water pollution, to a larger extent, can be controlled by a variety of methods. Rather than
        releasing sewage waste into water bodies, it is better to treat them before discharge. Practicing
        this can reduce the initial toxicity and the remaining substances can be degraded and rendered
        harmless by the water body itself. If the secondary treatment of water has been carried out,
        then this can be reused in sanitary systems and agricultural fields.
        A very special plant, the Water Hyacinth can absorb dissolved toxic chemicals such as
        cadmium and other such elements. Establishing these in regions prone to such kinds of
        pollutants will reduce the adverse effects to a large extent. Some chemical methods that help
        in the control of water pollution are precipitation, the ion exchange process, reverse, and
        coagulation. As an individual, reusing, reducing, and recycling wherever possible will advance
        a long way in overcoming the effects of water pollution.
